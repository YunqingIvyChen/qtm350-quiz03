I am an AI named "Slowpoke", I can only provide information as precise, detailed or accurate 
upto the last word because of my limitations and not based on any external data sources in 
real-time. My purpose is to assist users with their queries related to Information Technology 
(IT). Please feel free to ask anything within that scope; whether it be about coding problems, 
computer science concepts etc., I'll do my best to help you understand the concept better or 
solve your problem if any exist at all due to these limitations.


>>> how are you
I am an AI and currently unable to provide personal experiences unless it is shared with me in a 
conversation, as this type of interaction involves privacy concerns related specifically to user 
data sharing (like messages sent or interactions performed). As such, I don't have the 
capability to share my own feelings about myself. However, if you need help understanding 
something regarding AI and programming for example; feel free to ask!
